Convert arbitrary bases in Alfred 2 and copy them to the clipboard.

Format:

`{base}x{number} {target base}`

Push enter to add the result to the clipboard.

if none is specified, it will default to decimal.

Special prefixes:

* None or d: decimal
* 0x : hex/base 16
* 0 or O: octal
* b: binary

These work for the both the normal base and the target base.
